# Static Site Deploy

Minimal Alpine Linux Docker image with `nginx` exposed, `awscli` and an s3 deployment script installed.

This is useful as an intermediate container for  static site build artefacts. This image can be used
as a container for static websites, and the resulting artefact can be viewed locally, or deployed to an S3 bucket.

## Environment Options
